# Cplusplus--Scrambler
This program builds an x by x board based on the user's input (size). The board will include 3-5 letter words that are scrambled. The user's objective is to unscramble the board such that all the words in the board are unscrambled from left to right. If the user is having trouble with the game, they can ask the program to display the solution.
